Beer Rating/Review Webscraping and Analysis

This repo contains my R code to scrape beer advocate.com for beer reviews and ratings.

Files:
============
1) BeerScraper.R        - This R file retrieves the beer information (patience, lots of info to get).
2) beer_data_1.Rdata    - This is the Rworkspace that contains the finished data (about 73k reviews of 250 beers). This was retrieved January, 2014.
3) Trend_Analysis.R     - This R file analyzes trends in beer ratings.  The first trend to report on is the seasonality of bitter beers.
